// plugin-doctor's OWN self-contained CUE schema — the SINGLE SOURCE for this plugin's
// declaration surface, used two ways exactly like every other plugin's schema (there is
// no schema-less plugin):
//
//  1. SERVE over Describe — the host splices `base ++ plugin` at the load gate, so the
//     plugin's declarations travel WITH it and a self-contained schema that will not
//     splice is a LOUD load failure.
//  2. DOCUMENT the plugin's published surface — the reference site's per-plugin page is
//     rendered from its providers, this schema, and the candy description.
//
// command:doctor's authored input is its pass-through CLI grammar (the OpRun `{args:
// [...]}` envelope) and verb:freshness-guard is invoked by the kernel's preflight phase,
// so this schema DOCUMENTS both capability contracts rather than a structured
// plugin_input. SELF-CONTAINED: it references no base def, so it compiles STANDALONE
// (the property that lets the SDK compile it serve-side).
#DoctorPlugin: {
	// The declared capability words (the plugin.providers surface) — the command:doctor
	// CLI plus the verb:freshness-guard preflight hook — so this schema and charly.yml's
	// `plugin.providers:` list cannot silently drift.
	providers: [...string]

	// The command word the plugin serves.

	// The verb word the kernel's preflight phase invokes.
	verb: "freshness-guard"
